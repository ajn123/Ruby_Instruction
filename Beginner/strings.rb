# Strings are a way to represent words and characters in Ruby.  One
# big difference you will notice is what surrounds strings.  single
# quotes mean that the string is a string literal and has no special
# formatting/injection.
puts 'hello there' # => hello there

# Strings with double quotes may have ruby code inserted into them with
# the user of #{YOUR_CODE_HERE}.
puts "I am #{9+20} years old" # =>  I am 29 years old
